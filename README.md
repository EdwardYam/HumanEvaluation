# HumanEvaluation

It is a tool which can easily help annotators to score the quality of responses.

This tool is based on HTML. To get a more beautiful interface and a more powerful function. I use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js">FileSaver.js</a>.

When you try to use this tool, you should prepare a .csv file which is seperated in "\t". Here is an example:

    I am a student \t oh, Where are you from? \t I am from china. \t

The last colmun should be left so that the score can be written.
